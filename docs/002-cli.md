# hyprmcsr CLI

The `hyprmcsr` script is the main entry point for all automation tasks in this toolkit.

## Add to your PATH

You can run it directly from the `bin/` folder, or add it to your `$PATH` for convenience:

```bash
export PATH="$PATH:/path/to/hyprmcsr/bin"
```

Now you can use `hyprmcsr` from anywhere in your terminal.
