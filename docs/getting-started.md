# Getting Started

Welcome to **hyprmcsr** â€“ the Linux Minecraft speedrunning automation toolkit!

This documentation will guide you through the setup and usage of hyprmcsr on a modern Linux system with Hyprland.

- For a general Linux MCSR guide, see [linux-mcsr by Saanvi](https://its-saanvi.github.io/linux-mcsr/).
  Most sections are relevant for this toolkit as well, **except** for the parts about Resetti, splitting audio streams, keymap rebinds, and setting up i3.  
  Those topics are either handled differently or automatically by hyprmcsr.
