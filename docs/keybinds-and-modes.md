# Keybinds and Modes

hyprmcsr manages all important keybinds for you:

- **Mode switching:** Change window size, sensitivity, and more with a single keypress.
- **Custom binds:** Define your own keybinds for scripts, OBS actions, etc.
- **Toggle binds:** Quickly enable/disable custom binds.

All binds are defined in your profile config under the `binds` section.

**Tip:**  
You can use environment variables like `$WINDOW_ADDRESS`, `$SCRIPT_DIR`, `$PROFILE`, `HYPRMCSR_PROFILE` etc. in your custom commands.
