# Boat Eye Mode

The "Boat Eye" mode is a special Minecraft speedrunning setup where the field of view is stretched vertically to maximize visibility while boating. To comply with speedrun.com rules, the Boat Eye view must be shown as a separate overlay in your recording and must be togglable.

## OBS Configuration

See [OBS Setup](./013-obs-setup.md) for general instructions.  
For Boat Eye, it is recommended to create a dedicated OBS scene:

1. **Create a new scene** in OBS, e.g., "BoatEyeScene".
2. **Add a dedicated Game Capture source** that captures Minecraft.
3. **Adjust the source:**
   - **Position:** Centered
   - **Size:** Set the bounding box to **half the width and half the height** of your monitor resolution (e.g., 960x540 for 1920x1080).
   - **Alignment:** Centered
4. **Project** this scene to a second monitor if desired.

## Automatic Overlay Toggle with obs-cli

To show or hide the Boat Eye overlay as required by the rules, you can use [obs-cli](https://github.com/pschmitt/obs-cli).  
Example configuration in your profile (`example.default.profile.json`):

```json
// Excerpt from "modeSwitch" in example.default.profile.json
"boat-eye": {
  "size": "384x16384",
  "sensitivity": "-0.9375",
  "onEnter": [
    "# ~/.local/bin/razer-cli --dpi 100",
    "~/.local/bin/obs-cli item show --scene BoatEyeScene GameCapture"
  ],
  "onExit": [
    "# ~/.local/bin/razer-cli --dpi 1800",
    "~/.local/bin/obs-cli item hide --scene BoatEyeScene GameCapture"
  ]
}
```
- When Boat Eye is activated, the overlay is shown; when leaving, it is hidden.
- Adjust paths and scene names as needed for your setup.

**To calculate the optimal pointer speed:**  
Use this tool: [Pixel-Perfect-Tools/calc](https://priffin.github.io/Pixel-Perfect-Tools/calc.html)  
Note: The tool uses Windows pointer speed.

### Conversion Table: Windows â†’ Linux

| Windows |   1 |   2 |   3 |   4 |   5 |   6 |   7 |   8 |   9 |  10 |  11 |  12 |  13 |  14 |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| xinput  | 0.03125 | 0.0625 | 0.125 | 0.25 | 0.375 | 0.5 | 0.625 | 0.75 | 0.875 | 1 | 1.25 | 1.5 | 1.75 | 2 |
| libinput| -0.96875 | -0.9375 | -0.875 | -0.75 | -0.625 | -0.5 | -0.375 | -0.25 | -0.125 | 0 | 0.25 | 0.5 | 0.75 | 1 |

- For hyprmcsr, you can set the value directly as `"sensitivity"` in your profile (libinput value recommended).
