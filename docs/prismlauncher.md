# PrismLauncher

PrismLauncher is required to manage your Minecraft instances for speedrunning.

It is recommended to use the **Flatpak version** for best compatibility with hyprmcsr.

## Installation (Flatpak)

You can install PrismLauncher via Flatpak with:

```bash
flatpak install flathub org.prismlauncher.PrismLauncher
```

For more details and tips, see the [PrismLauncher section in the linux-mcsr guide](https://its-saanvi.github.io/linux-mcsr/minecraft/mmc.html).

After installation, launch PrismLauncher and set up your Minecraft instances as usual.  
hyprmcsr will automatically detect and use your configured PrismLauncher instance.
