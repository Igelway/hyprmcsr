# OBS Setup

- Install OBS Studio and obs-vkcapture via Flatpak.
- Use monitor capture for best compatibility, or obs-gamecapture for direct game capture.
- For "Boat Eye" mode, create a separate scene with a resized game capture source.

**Automation:**  
hyprmcsr can control OBS via [obs-cli](https://github.com/pschmitt/obs-cli) and the OBS websocket (authentication can be disabled for simplicity).

See [linux-mcsr OBS guide](https://its-saanvi.github.io/linux-mcsr/obs.html) for more tips.
