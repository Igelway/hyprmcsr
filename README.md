## Overview

**hyprmcsr** is a toolkit for automating a modern Minecraft speedrunning environment on Linux, with a focus on performance, usability, and automation.  
It is especially useful for runners looking for a streamlined, performant alternative to the typical Windows-based MCSR setup.

The toolkit leverages [Hyprland](https://hyprland.org/) (Wayland compositor), Pipewire, PrismLauncher, and various helper tools to provide:
- Automated window management and keybinds
- Audio splitting for game/Discord/OBS
- Input remapping for optimal controls
- Easy mod and tool management (auto-download)
- Integration with OBS and other speedrun helpers

All core functionality is controlled via the `hyprmcsr` CLI, which manages setup, teardown, and automation for your speedrun sessions.
