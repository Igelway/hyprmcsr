## Overview

This project automates the setup of a Minecraft speedrunning environment on Linux using Hyprland, Pipewire, and various helper tools. The focus is on simplicity and making it easy to adapt or extend for your own needs.

**Configuration is now split:**
- Global settings: `config.json` (copied from `example.config.json` on first install)
- Profile-specific settings: `<profile>.profile.json` (e.g. `default.profile.json`, copied from `example.default.profile.json`)

Tested on Fedora 42.  
If you have problems, feel free to open an issue.
