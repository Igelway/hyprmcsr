# hyprmcsr

## Overview

This project automates the setup of a Minecraft speedrunning environment on Linux using Hyprland, Pipewire, and various helper tools. The focus is on simplicity and making it easy to adapt or extend for your own needs.
Configuration is centralized in the `config.json` file.  
Installation and setup of required JARs, Pipewire configuration, and keybinds are handled automatically via the install script.
I only tested it on my own system: Fedora 42.
If you have problems with this library, feel free to write an issue.

## Requirements

Before installing, make sure you have the following dependencies installed on your system and in your PATH:

- **Hyprland** (Wayland compositor)
- **Pipewire** (with Flatpak support)
- **OBS Studio** (Flatpak version)
- **java**
- **PrismLauncher** (Flatpak version)
- **obs-vkcapture** (Flatpak plugin for OBS)
- **input-remapper** (for remapping mouse and keyboard inputs)
- **jq** (for JSON parsing in shell scripts)
- **curl** (for downloading JARs and GitHub API requests)
- **git** (for cloning this repository)
- **bash** (most scripts are written for bash)

Make sure your user is in the appropriate groups (e.g., `input` for input-remapper) and that you have permission to run `sudo` commands for input-remapper control.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Relacibo/hyprmcsr
   cd hyprmcsr
   ```

2. **Configure pipewire**
   Rename `example.config.json` to `config.json`. Change `pipewireLoopback.playbackTarget` in `config.json` to your default output (e.g. headset). You can list your outputs with `pactl list short sinks`. Use the full name in the second column. You can leave this field empty; the default output will be used.

3. **Run the install script**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/install.sh
   ```
   - Downloads all JARs that are listed in `download.jars` in `config.json` automatically.
   - Sets up Pipewire configuration for audio splitting.
   - You can always rerun that script, if you want to update

## Configuration (`config.json`)

All important settings are made in the `config.json` file in the project root.  
See [example.config.json](example.config.json) for a full example.

**Key fields:**

- **onStart**: Array of shell commands/scripts to run in the background when starting (e.g. starting helper tools, OBS, etc.).  
  The variables `$SCRIPT_DIR` and `$PROFILE` are available in each command.
- **onDestroy**: Array of shell commands/scripts to run in the background when stopping (e.g. cleanup, notifications, killing helper tools).  
  The variables `$SCRIPT_DIR` and `$PROFILE` are available in each command.
- **binds.toggleBinds**: Key combination to toggle binds.
- **binds.modeSwitch**: Key combinations for switching between window modes.
- **modeSwitch.default**: Default window size, sensitivity, and optional `onEnter`/`onExit` arrays for commands to run when entering or exiting a mode.
- **modeSwitch.modes**: Per-mode overrides for size, sensitivity, and `onEnter`/`onExit` commands.
- **inputRemapper.devices**: List of devices and presets for input-remapper.
- **minecraft.prismPrefixOverride**: (Optional) Path to your PrismLauncher data directory.
- **minecraft.prismInstanceId**: Name or UUID of your PrismLauncher instance.
- **minecraft.windowTitleRegex**: Regex to detect the Minecraft window.
- **minecraft.observeLog.enabled**: Enable or disable log observation for Minecraft state.
- **pipewireLoopback.enabled**: Enable or disable Pipewire audio loopback/splitting.
- **pipewireLoopback.playbackTarget**: Audio output for Pipewire split (e.g., your headset).  
  Tip: You can leave this field empty. If loopback is enabled, running `install.sh` will automatically detect and set your default output here.
- **download.jar**: Array of GitHub repositories (or URLs in the future) for required JARs to be downloaded automatically.
- **autoDestroyOnExit**: If true, runs cleanup automatically when the main script exits.

**Tip:**  
You can use variables like `$SCRIPT_DIR`, `$PROFILE`, `$PREVIOUS_MODE`, and `$NEXT_MODE` in your shell commands in `onStart`, `onDestroy`, `onEnter`, and `onExit`.

## Usage

### Setup and Start

- **Setup and start all tools:**
  ```bash
  ./scripts/start.sh [--coop]
  ```
  - Starts Minecraft (via Prism), sets up keybinds.
  - Also executes the items in onStart in `config.json`.

- **Restart Minecraft only:**
  ```bash
  ./scripts/minecraft.sh
  ```
  - Only starts Minecraft (e.g., when it crashed) and re-applies audio/window handling. You have to restart it like this, otherwise the binds/audio splitting will not work.

- **Remove keybinds and stop input remapper:**
  ```bash
  ./scripts/destroy.sh
  ```
  - Removes all keybinds and stops input-remapper. (Doesn't need to be called, if `autoDestroyOnExit` is true, which it is on default.)
  - Calls the scripts in onDestroy in `config.json`

## OBS Capture

For capturing Minecraft, this setup uses [obs-vkcapture](https://github.com/nowrep/obs-vkcapture).  
You should install the Flatpak versions of both OBS Studio and PrismLauncher, as well as the Flatpak version of obs-vkcapture.

**How to use:**
- In PrismLauncher, set the wrapper command for your Minecraft instance to:
  ```
  obs-gamecapture
  ```
- This will allow obs-vkcapture to hook into the Minecraft window for seamless game capture in OBS.

**Installation:**
- Install OBS Studio and PrismLauncher via Flatpak.
- Install obs-vkcapture for Flatpak OBS:
  ```bash
  flatpak install com.obsproject.Studio.Plugin.OBSVkCapture
  ```
- For more details, see the [obs-vkcapture GitHub page](https://github.com/nowrep/obs-vkcapture).

### Minecraft Capture

#### Monitor recording (Recommended)
Just use the monitor recording with pipewire on which minecraft is running, as it will capture the cursor with no problems.

#### With OBS-Capture
- Create a **Game Capture** source in your main scene that captures Minecraft.
- Set the transformation of the Game Capture source as follows:
  - **Bounding box type:** Scale to inner bounds
  - **Alignment in bounding box:** Center
  - **Bounding box size:** Set to your monitor's resolution (e.g., 1920x1080 for a 1080p monitor)

**Limitations:**
- Currently, the monitor where Minecraft runs must be positioned at the very top-left of your monitor setup, if it is recorded at all...

### Boat Eye

To use the "Boat Eye" mode, you need to set up a second scene in OBS:

- **Create a new scene** in OBS specifically for Boat Eye.
- **Add a separate Game Capture source** to this scene, capturing Minecraft as usual.
- Don't use cursor capturing
- Set the transformation of the Game Capture source as follows:
  - **Position:** Centered
  - **Size:** Set the bounding box to **half the width and half the height of your monitor resolution** (e.g., 960x540 for a 1920x1080 monitor)
  - **Alignment:** Center

This ensures the Boat Eye mode is displayed correctly.  
Adjust these values if you use a different monitor resolution.

You can then open this scene as a projector in OBS and keep it running on a secondary monitor while playing.

## Optional Tools

In the `onEnter` and `onExit` fields in your `config.json` (example: [example.config.json](example.config.json)) I use the following tools, for automation:

- [**razer-cli**](https://github.com/lolei/razer-cli)  
  Command-line tool to set DPI and other settings for Razer mice.

- [**obs-cli**](https://github.com/pschmitt/obs-cli)  
  Command-line client for OBS Studio, allowing you to control scenes, sources, and more from scripts.  

## Notes

- The scripts are made for use with Hyprland and Pipewire.
- Most settings (devices, instance names, audio output, etc.) are controlled via `config.json`.
- Don't run the scripts with `sudo`. The scripts use `sudo`, where needed (input-remapper). That also means, that you have to type in your password, when running `start.sh` and `destroy.sh`
- You do not necessarily need to run `toggle_mode.sh`, as it is run by the from the binds, that are created in `start.sh`
